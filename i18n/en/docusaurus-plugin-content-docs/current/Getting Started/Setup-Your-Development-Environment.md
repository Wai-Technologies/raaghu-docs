# Setup Your Development Environment

First things first! Let's setup your development environment before creating the project.

### Pre-Requirements

The following tools should be installed on your development machine:

An IDE (e.g. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)) that supports [.NET 8.0+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) development.

[Node v16 or v18](https://nodejs.org/en) 

 [Yarn v1.20+ (not v2)^1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable) or **npm v6+** (already installed with Node)

[ABP CLI](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/CLI) (command line interface that is used to automate some common tasks for ABP based solutions)

> **Note:**
> Please check if you have access to Raaghu Portal with your Admin before proceeding ahead.

## Install the Raaghu CLI
